        <h1>Brandon Dam and KPOP</h1>
            <p>Throughout this semester and specifically in this course, I have decided to dedicate all the practices and code related to <strong>KPOP</strong> to motivate me.
            I have been a fan since 2019 but started to be <strong>heavily</strong> interested since late 2021/early 2022.
            My ultimate favorite group is <a href="https://kprofiles.com/twice-members-profile/" title="Twice" target="_blank">Twice</a>, but I am also very interested in both <a href="https://kprofiles.com/black-pink-members-profile/" title="Blackpink" target="_blank">Blackpink</a> and <a href="https://kprofiles.com/stray-kids-members-profile-facts/" title="Stray Kids" target="_blank">Stray Kids.</a>
            Twice is a 9 member girl group that debuted in 2015 after their survival show <em>Sixteen</em>. The members name are Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu being the youngest member.
            Blackpink is a 4 member girl group with Jisoo, Jennie, Rose, and Lisa. Stray Kids is an 8 member boy group with Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and lastly I.N.
